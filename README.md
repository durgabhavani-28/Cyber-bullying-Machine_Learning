# 🤖 Cyberbullying Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Problem Statement
Cyberbullying on social media causes emotional distress and mental health issues.  
Manual moderation is inefficient.  
The problem: **How to automatically detect cyberbullying in text?**

---

## 🎯 Goal / Objective
- Build an **ML model** to classify text messages into bullying/non-bullying categories.  
- Improve accuracy using text preprocessing and NLP techniques.  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- Collect and preprocess dataset (tweets, comments).  
- Clean text (remove stopwords, punctuation).  
- Extract features using **TF-IDF** or word embeddings.  
- Train ML classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest).  
- Evaluate performance with metrics.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **scikit-learn, pandas, numpy**  
- **NLTK / spaCy** for text preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** for visualization

🔑 Code Explanation (Snippet)
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_texts)

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

preds = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, preds))
